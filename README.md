# My Interior Design
Practicing lightmapping in Unity. 

There are many realistic samples of interior design available on Unity and Unreal. Therefore, I think it's not a big issue today. We just need to set up the lightmap properly, and everything will go on automatically. But, is it really that simple? if YES, should I be able to do it well by myself, right?
